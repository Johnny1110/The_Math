# The_Math

<br>

A jounary to know math

## Target

I created this GitNote on 2025/05/22. I'm 26 years old (soon to be 27). I've been doing software development many years, but I still don't feel I'm a qualified engineer for everything I want to acheive.

I saw geniuses like Dr.Gavin Wood, who designed Polkadot blockchain and published the EVM yellow paper and JAM grey paper. That's the kind of engineer I aspire to be - more creative more closer to the truth.

So I guess math is the key, to let me enter the new world of high level engineer, I know it's hard but I think I need to give it a shot. No matter what, I will just keep updating this learning log every week and follow the catelog schedule. Let's see where we are in 2 or 3 years.

Stay hungry, stay humble.
